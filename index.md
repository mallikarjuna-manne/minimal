### Lending Club Case Study

Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Identifying these risky loan applicants can reduce amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
